System tests
- player tries to split, can't if they don't have enough chips to match original bet
- player gets one blackjack out of two split hands
- set a player's chips to 0
    - when there was 1 player: game ended
    - when there were multiple players: game continued with other players
- set dealer hand to a blackjack
    - insurance situations:
        - set ace face up
            - buy insurance with half of original bet
            - try to buy insurance when no chips remaining
- set deck to be empty
    - before dealing
    - after dealing
            
Points of improvement:
- when offering insurance, tell player how much they can buy maximum right away instead of in a tooltip
